# AlgoViz

**AlgoViz** is an interactive Flutter application designed to visualize various data structures and algorithms. It provides dynamic visual representations to enhance understanding of complex concepts such as insertion, deletion, searching, and balancing operations in different tree structures.

## Features

- **Tree Operations Visualization:**
  - **Insertion:** Demonstrates how elements are added to various tree structures.
  - **Deletion:** Illustrates the process of removing elements from trees.
  - **Searching:** Shows how search operations traverse the tree to find elements.
  - **Balancing:** Visualizes balancing operations in self-balancing trees like AVL and Red-Black Trees.

- **Interactive Controls:**
  - **Step-by-Step Execution:** Allows users to control the pace of algorithm execution.
  - **Custom Input:** Users can input their own data to see how the algorithms handle different scenarios.
  - **Speed Adjustment:** Modify the speed of visualizations for a tailored learning experience.

- **Educational Resources:**
  - **Detailed Explanations:** Each visualization is accompanied by comprehensive explanations of the underlying concepts and operations.
  - **Code Snippets:** Provides relevant code snippets to bridge the gap between theory and implementation.
